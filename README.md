# Marilla Hulls Portfolio
Welcome! This is my coding portfolio

*All pieces of code displayed on this portfolio were completed as part of Dalhousie University's **NESC 3505: Neural Data Science** course*

**Single Unit Data**

Here's an example of some code I wrote to [create a peri-stimulus time histogram from a 3D numpy array](PSTH_code.ipynb)
The output looks like [this](psth_image.png)

**EDA / Data Visualization**

Here's an example of some code I wrote on a project (in collaboration with Devon Bode) to create a [box plot dsiplaying multiple different conditions grouped by hue](colorblind_boxplot.ipynb)
The output looks like [this](colorblind_boxplot_image.ipynb)

**Other**

Just for fun, here's an example of some [Github Copliot prompts](Copilot_prompts.ipynb) I engineered to produce the requested output without needing to make manual changes to the code. These Github Copliot prompts are for the purpose of working with and manipulating pandas dataframes
