# Marilla Hulls Portfolio
Welcome! This is my coding portfolio

*All pieces of code displayed on this portfolio were completed as part of Dalhousie University's **NESC 3505: Neural Data Science** course*

**Single Unit Data**
Here's an example of some code I wrote to [create a peri-stimulus time histogram from a 3D numpy array](PSTH_code.ipynb)

**Other**
Just for fun, here's an example of some [Github Copliot prompts](Copilot_prompts.ipynb) I engineered to produce the requested output without needing to make manual changes to the code
