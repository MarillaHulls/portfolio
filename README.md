# Marilla Hulls Portfolio
Welcome! This is my coding portfolio

*All pieces of code displayed on this portfolio were completed as part of Dalhousie University's **NESC 3505: Neural Data Science** course*

**Single Unit Data**

Here's an example of some code I wrote to [create a peri-stimulus time histogram from a 3D numpy array](PSTH_code1.md).
The output looks like [this](psth_image.png)!


**EDA / Data Visualization**

Here's an example of some code I wrote on a project (in collaboration with Devon Bode) to create a [box plot displaying multiple different conditions grouped by hue](colorblind_boxplot1.md).
The output looks like [this](colorblind_boxplot_image.png)!


**Working with pandas DataFrames**

Here's an example of some code I wrote to edit the values in a pandas DataFrame in order to [perform a chi-squared test of independence](chisquare.md) when the expected counts assumption was violated.
The dataset used was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shariful07/student-mental-health).


**Other**

Just for fun, here's an example of some [Github Copliot prompts](copilot_prompts1.md) I engineered to produce the requested output without needing to make manual changes to the code. These Github Copliot prompts are for the purpose of working with and manipulating pandas dataframes.
